# Deepbug

In order to build the benchmarks, run `sbt assembly`
to generate the JAR. Then you can use the `sweep....py`
files in the `scripts` directory.
The data from our runs is available in the `results` directory.
Our plots generated with `scripts/plot.py` can be found in the
`plots` directory.
